Lets users edit/modify core WordPress and Leads email templates. 

== Description ==

Requires [WordPress Leads Plugin ](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/leads ) to work. 

This Inbound Now plugin allows users to edit core WordPress & core Inbound Now's Leads Plugin's email templates. This extension also extends Inbound Form email confirmations, allowing users to create & edit html emails sent to users after successful form submissions. 

At the moment these features are built into Leads, so there is no reason for Inbound Now users to download it. But very soon we are removing these features from core.
